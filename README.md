All data is smoothed and collected on a weekly basis

DAYS ON MARKET AND PRICE CUTS
- `Days to Pending`: How long it takes homes in a region to change to pending status on Zillow.com after first being shown as for sale. The reported figure indicates the number of days (mean or median) that it took for homes that went pending during the week being reported, to go pending. This differs from the old “Days on Zillow” metric in that it excludes the in-contract period before a home sells.
- `Share of Listings With a Price Cut`: The number of unique properties with a list price at the end of the month that’s less than the list price at the beginning of the month, divided by the number of unique properties with an active listing at some point during the month.
-`Price Cuts`: The mean and median price cut for listings in a given region during a given time period, expressed as both dollars ($) and as a percentage (%) of list price.
